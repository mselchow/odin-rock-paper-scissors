# Rock Paper Scissors

The goal of this project was to implement a basic version of Rock Paper Scissors using Javascript, that is run through the console. By default, the game runs through five rounds before announcing a winner.

To play, open index.html in your browser, right click anywhere, and select "Inspect" to open the developer tools for your browser. From there, select console, then run `game()` in the console to start the game.
